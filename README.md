# Game-Bot-using-Genetic-Algortihm

The bot plays the game on its own and learns over time from its previous runs (40 bots play the game each time).
New bots are created from the best performing bots of the previous generation until we reach the score of 20000 where the perfect bot is considered to be made.
Just changing up things uselessly without any particular purpose.

# How to run : 

1. Download and extract the zip file
2. Change the path of the images wherever necessary in the code to the relative path
3. Run the Environment.py file to play with birds and trees as obstacles or Run the env_copy.py file to play with trees appearing randomly anywhere on the screen to the right of the player and of course without those birds
4. Nothing Else
